Things to ask Sin Wah during the *__SM19 Questions and Knowledge Sharing__* meeting with **Sin Wah** and **Ken**: 

1. The current ThingWorx license we have, when will it expire? Will we not be able to use it once it expires? Will it auto renew upon expiration?
   1. 192.1
   2. new ThingWorx will be installed in the same VM
2. Do we need to activate the new ThingWorx license on the day the old one expires, or it doesn't matter?
3. Where will the new ThingWorx license be installed? A new VM, or it will be the same ThingWorx, but just a different license?
4. Do we need to re-configure ThingWorx? Leave it to PDSol to do the job? Last year how was ThingWorx installed?

Slide updates from:

* Renuga
* Ken

PDSol will send email to Sin Wah two months before the ThingWorx license expires, asking whether he would like to renew the license or not.
