Supervised learning takes off in recent years thanks to the <mark>large amount</mark> of data available and the development of neural network.

### How to get data:
* Manually labeling
* From observing (users' or machines') behaviors
* Download from website / partnerships

### Use and mis-use of data
Don't wait until accumulating **enough** data. Get the AI team work on the data from the start.

The data may not generate valuable results.

### Data is messy
Unstructured data and structured data.

### Machine learning vs Data science

### AI Transformation
1. Execute <mark>pilot projects</mark> to gain momentum
2. Build an in-house AI team
3. Provide broad AI training
4. Develop an AI strategy
5. Develop internal and external communications

### What makes an ML problem easier
1. Learning a "simple" concept
   * The problem takes a human less than 1 second of mental thought to solve.
2. Lots of data abailable

### Machine learning project workflow
1. Collect data
2. Train model
3. Deploy

### Data science project workflow
1. Collect data
2. Analyze data
   * Iterate many times to get good insights
3. Suggest hypotheses / actions
   * Deploy changes
   * Re-analyze new data periodically

### How to choose an AI project -> Brainstorming framework
* Think about automating tasks rather than automating jobs.
* What are the main drivers of business value?
* What are the main pain point in the business.

Before commiting to an AI project, do due diligence.

## Working with an AI team

One `pitfall` when working with AI team is to `expect 100% accuracy` from the AI software, because of

* Limitations of ML
* Insufficient data
* Mislabeled data
* Ambiguous labels

## Technical tools for AI teams

### Machine learning frameworks:
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch
* Keras
* MXNet
* CNTK
* Caffe
* PaddlePaddle
* Scikit-learn
* R
* Weka

### Research publications:
* Arxiv

### Example roles of an AI team
* Software Engineer
* Machine Learning Engineer
   * Training
* Machine Learning Researcher
   * Extend state-of-the-art in ML
* `Applied ML Scientist` (fusion of the above two)
* Data Scientist
   * Examine data and provide insights
   * Make presentation to team/executive
* Data Engineer
   - Organize data
   - Make sure data is saved in an easily accessible, secure and cost effective way
* AI Product Manager
   * Help decide what to build; what's feasible and valuable

Getting started with a small team.
* 1 Software Engineer, or
* 1 Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist, or
* Nobody but yourself

## AI Transformation Playbook
1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
   * More important for the initial project to succeed rather than be the most valuable
   * Show traction within 6-12 months
   * Can be in-house or outsourced
2. Build an in-house AI team
3. Provide broad AI training
   * Executives and senior business leaders
      * What AI can do for your enterprise
      * AI strategy
      * Resource allocation
   * Leaders of divisions working on AI projects
      * Set project direction (technical and business diligence)
      * Resource allocation
      * Monitor progress
   * AI engineer trainees
      * Build and ship AI software
      * Gather data
      * Execute on specific AI projects
4. Develop an AI strategy
   * Leverage AI to create an advantage specific to your industry sector
   * Design strategy aligned with the "`Virtuous Cycle of AI`" (positive feedback loop)
   * **Lots of AI needs to be specialized or verticalized for your industry sector**
   * Consider creating a data strategy
      * Strategic data acquisition
      * Unified data warehouse
   * Create network effects and platform advantages
      * In industries with "`winner takes all/most`" dynamics, AI can be an accelerator
5. Develop internal and external communications
   * Investor relations
   * Government relations
   * Consumer/user education
   * Talent/recruitment
   * Internal communications

## AI pitfalls to aviod
* Don't expect AI to solve everything
   * Be realistic about what AI can and cannot do given limitations of technology, data, and engineering resources
* Don't just hire 2-3 ML engineers and count solely on them to come up with use cases
   * Pair engineering talent with business talent and work cross-functionally to find feasible and valuable projects
* Don't expect the AI project to work the first time
   * Plan for AI development to be an iterative process, with multiple attempts needed to succeed
* Don't expect traditional planning processes to apply without changes
   * Work with AI team to establish timeline estimates, milestones, KPIs, etc.
* Don't think you need superstar AI engineers before you can do anything
