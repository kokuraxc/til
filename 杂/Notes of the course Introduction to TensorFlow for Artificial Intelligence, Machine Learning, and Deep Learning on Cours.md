### Notes of the course *Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning* on *Coursera*

#### Google Colab

* Colab, short for *Colaboratory*, is a **hosted Jupyter notebook service** that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.
* Colab is free to use.
* Colab is based on Jupyter.
* Colab notebooks are stored in Google Drive, or can be loaded from GitHub.
* Choose "Upload notebook" from the File menu, to import an existing Jupyter/IPython notebook into Colab.
* Code is executed in a virtual machine private to your account.
* All Colab notebooks are stored in the open source Jupyter notebook format (`.ipynb`).
* Resources in Colab are prioritized for users who have recently used less resources, in order to prevent the monopolization of limited resources by a small number of users. To get the most out of Colab, consider closing your Colab tabs when you are done with your work, and avoid opting for a GPU when it is not needed for your work. This will make it less likely that you will run into usage limits in Colab.
