# northbound interface / southbound interface

A northbound interface is an interface that allows a particular component of a network to communicate with a higher-level component. Conversely, a southbound interface allows a particular network component to communicate with a lower-level component.

In a figurative sense, northbound flow can be thought of as going upward, while southbound flow can be thought of as going downward. In architectural diagrams, northbound interfaces are drawn at the top of the applicable component, while southbound interfaces are drawn at the bottom of the component.
